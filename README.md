# Succubus HTTP
### Hi! I'm succubus. A bot that's based off slash commands, and many options for images with them. I am sure to satisfy your needs~

I have an `/image` command that is able to add lbgtq+ filters to a members avatar! Plus a random `/nick` command that just provides a randomly generated nickname. (It doesn't change your nickname for you though!)

I have a couple other commands... but you'd have to add me to your server to test them and find out what they are. ;)
